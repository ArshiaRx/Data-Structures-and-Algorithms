> is used for the StdOut


To check the number of file do the following commands:
wc -l filename


towers    nDisks   From    Dest

towers     10       2       3

//Moves 10 disks from 2nd plate to 3rd plate


towers(10, 2, 3)


Should check if the tower is either 1, 2 or 3. it can not be less than 1, greater than 3
or the same, 
two argument should be invalid, greater than 3 also has to be invalid
it should give an error

if everything works used the exit(0)

- should modify towersMain.c


if the there is a error,  it should be outputted into stderr not the stdOut


instead VNCONNECT
